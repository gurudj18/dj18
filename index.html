What is ‘Dhruva Jnanam’?
<p>
It’s an online group started for children ages
five and above with the inspiration and
blessings of Brahmasri Dr. Samavedam
Shanmukha Sarma garu for the enablement of
children to grasp and follow dharmic values
and put them into practice with thorough
comprehension. This aids children in
amalgamating the morals, customs,
traditions, and culture of Sanatana Dharma
into their daily lifes with courage, confidence
and clarity. This also channelizes children’s
talents in various areas such as writing,
oratory, singing etc., and mentoring them to
achieve ‘Success with Character’ in all fields
and transform into future responsible leaders.</p>

<div id="objectivesPanel" class="panel">
    Objectives of ‘Dhruva Jnanam’
<p>
<ol>  
<li>To expose children to Sanatana Dharma and its eternal values.</li>

<li>To empower children with vision, discipline and dynamism.</li>

<li>To inculcate the practice of Sanatana Dharma corroborating with rational and
scientific thinking.</li>

<li>To instill pride in our ancient heritage and inspire them to hand over our traditions,
customs and observances to future generations .</li>

<li>To emphasize that learning about God should be cultivated from childhood itself,
exemplifying Bala Ganapati, Bala Siva, Bala Bhima, Bala Krishna, Bala Tripura Sundari,
Bala Hanuman etc.
</li></ol>
The eternal truth, profound knowledge, universality of application and magnanimity
embedded in Sanatana Dharma can best be understood, when one reminisces about how
young Naren filled with a temperament of rhetoric, rationality and reasoning, later got
transformed into Swami Vivekananda and became a world leader.</p>
